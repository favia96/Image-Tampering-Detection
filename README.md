# Image Tampering Detection and Localization

Project - Multimedia Data Security (145614) - Federico Favia & Kamil Rzechowski & Martin De Pellegrini, December 2018, University of Trento, Trento

This Matlab project developed within the course of Multimedia Data Security at University of Trento investigates some ways to detect if an image is tampered and localizate the inserted artifact. The technique can be [PRNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-pattern_noise) based or [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) based. All the sistem was trained on a development set provided by the University course (based on 4 photocameras PRNU) and then tested on a unknown set. See the report for more information. Remember to install on Matlab the jpegtbx_1.4. Below some snapshots from the results:
